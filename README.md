# AI-Task-Browser
This is a personal assistant AI agent which executes what I want done online, eg, find me the best deals on second hand laptops.

The goal of this AI agent is to:

1). Understand user intent : The agent will be able to interpret what I want it to do.

2). Search across platforms : It could browse websites, APIs, or databases to gather relevant information.

3). Filter and prioritize results : The agent should analyze the data and return only the most relevant or actionable results.

4). Perform actions : Optionally, the agent could take further steps like booking tickets, sending emails, or saving results to a database.

The major goal is to relieve myself from clicking endlessly from browser tab to tab as it can be overwhelming sometimes :-). In other words I want to be able to use the internet simply by instructing an agent that does stuff for me while i relax and drink some cool aid :-)
